# Semaphores implementation on archaeological site

The ratio in which visitors are guided by the guides is 3:1.

If visitors apply to enter the archaeological site without the required number of guides mentioned in the ratio, then they queue up until a guide enters.

Guided tour time: 7 min

Inspectors enter the site at random times to check that the 3:1 ratio is being maintained.
